 <h1>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</h1>
What it is: MAE measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted values and actual values, without considering their direction (i.e., it doesn't matter whether the prediction is too high or too low).
How to interpret: Lower MAE values indicate better predictive accuracy. If MAE = 0, it means your model's predictions are perfect.

<h1>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</h1>
What it is: MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones.
How to interpret: Like MAE, lower MSE values are better. However, because it squares the errors, MSE is more sensitive to outliers.
