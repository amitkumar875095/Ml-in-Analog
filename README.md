 <h1>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</h1>
What it is: MAE measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted values and actual values, without considering their direction (i.e., it doesn't matter whether the prediction is too high or too low).
How to interpret: Lower MAE values indicate better predictive accuracy. If MAE = 0, it means your model's predictions are perfect.
